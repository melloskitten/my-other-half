 # My Other Half ❤️
 ### - a game about love
 In many languages, the word 'love' usually denotes a romantic relationship between two partners. In my mother tongue, you would say 'I love you' only to your partner. When I was starting to learn English, however, I noticed how often people said 'I love you' to each other - to basically everybody! It felt strange, but after some time, I started liking the broader meaning of 'love'.
 
  _Love is everywhere, maybe in different forms and shapes, but no matter if it's between you or your parents, friends, lover - __it's love, and there is always somebody who cares about you.___
 
 
 __My Other Half__ is a small puzzle game about finding your love, showing you the stories of different people, their loved ones, and how _different_ the term love can really be.
